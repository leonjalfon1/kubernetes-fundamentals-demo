```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: vote
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: vote
  template:

      labels:
        app: vote
    spec:
      containers:

- Ensure that a new replicaset was created

```
kubectl get rs
```

- Ensure that new pods were created (note that you will get a total of 3 pods, the replicaset will add 2 additional pods)

```
kubectl get pods
```

- Delete the pod created previously

```
kubectl delete pod vote
```

- Ensure that a new pod was created

```
kubectl get pods
```
